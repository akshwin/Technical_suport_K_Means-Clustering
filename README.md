## Technical Support Data Analysis

### Introduction

This report analyzes technical support data related to various problem types, average pending calls, average resolution time, recurrence frequency, replacement percentage, in-warranty percentage, and post-warranty percentage. The goal is to cluster similar cases to identify patterns and potential areas for improvement in technical support services.

### Steps

#### 1. Importing Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from scipy.stats import zscore
```

#### 2. Loading Dataset

```python
tech_supp_df = pd.read_csv("technical_support_data.csv")
```

#### 3. Data Preprocessing

```python
techSuppAttr = tech_supp_df.iloc[:, 1:]
techSuppScaled = techSuppAttr.apply(zscore)
```

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

```python
sns.pairplot(techSuppScaled, diag_kind='kde')
```

#### 5. Determining the Number of Clusters (K)

```python
clusters = range(1, 10)
meanDistortion = []

for k in clusters:
    model = KMeans(n_clusters=k)
    model.fit(techSuppScaled)
    prediction = model.predict(techSuppScaled)
    meanDistortion.append(sum(np.min(cdist(techSuppScaled, model.cluster_centers_, 'euclidean'), axis=1)) / techSuppScaled.shape[0])

plt.plot(clusters, meanDistortion, 'bx-')
plt.xlabel('k')
plt.ylabel('Mean distortion')
plt.title("Selecting k with elbow method")
```

#### 6. Clustering the Data

```python
final_model = KMeans(3)  # or the optimal K value obtained
final_model.fit(techSuppScaled)
prediction = final_model.predict(techSuppScaled)
tech_supp_df['Clusters'] = prediction
```

#### 7. Cluster Analysis

```python
cluster_0 = tech_supp_df[tech_supp_df['Clusters'] == 0]
cluster_1 = tech_supp_df[tech_supp_df['Clusters'] == 1]
cluster_2 = tech_supp_df[tech_supp_df['Clusters'] == 2]
```

#### 8. Repeat Analysis for Different K Values (Optional)

Repeat steps 5-7 for different K values if necessary for more refined clustering.

### Source

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the 'technical_support_data.csv' file, containing information about various technical support cases and their attributes.

### Conclusion

By applying K-means clustering to the technical support data, we identified clusters of similar cases. This analysis can help in understanding patterns of technical issues and tailoring support strategies accordingly. Further exploration and refinement of clustering parameters can provide more insights into improving technical support services.
